ovbject is a non primitive data type which stores the value in the form of key and pair
The Object type represents one of JavaScript's data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.

ways to creating objects

1) using object literals
2) using constrctors

objectliterals

we have two ways to acess the object literals
1)Dot
2) through objectname["property]

If you Understand Objects, you Understand JavaScript.
because in javascript everything is an object



Objects are objects
Maths are objects
Functions are objects
Dates are objects
Arrays are objects
Maps are objects
Sets are objects
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

what are primitives

we know primitives data types of 7 types 
string
number
boolean
null
undefined
symbol
bigint  so all the numbers stored by these data types are primitive data types

mutablity of objects

it is a refernce type datatype where it is compared based on the address type rather than value

objects rae mutable 
When you assign one object to another variable, you're not creating a copy of the object. Instead, you're creating a new reference to the same object in memory. Therefore, changes made to the object through either reference will be reflected in both. --line number 45
